# CRFL

## A Low-Cost Feature Interaction Fault Localization Approach for Software Product Lines

###Overview
Counterfactual Reasoning based Fault Localization (CRFL) is a low-cost approach for feature interaction faults of SPLs. CRFL has less dependency on the platform and libraries used, both Linux and Windows systems can use it normally.

### How to run CRFL?
We evaluate the performance of CRFL and the baselines using eight software product lines, six of which provide complete data versions available for download at [here](https://tuanngokien.github.io/splc2021/). The other two, BerkeleyDB and TankWar, consist of multiple variable-defect cases designed to assess the methodâ€™s capability to handle large-scale product lines. These datasets are accessible in the directory ./examples.

After preparing the data, set the system_name and buggy_systems_folder parameters in ObtainSusFeatureInteractions.py to execute the script directly.


The meaning of arguments are as following:
1. **system**: For example Email, GPL, or BerkeleyDB, etc
2. **buggy_systems_folder**: The path of the folder where you place the buggy versions of the systems, e.g. /Users/whn/SPLSystems/Email/1Bug/4wise/
3. **RQ1**: Controls whether RQ1 and RQ2 are executed, with a default setting of True.
4. **RQ3**: Controls whether RQ3 is executed, with a default setting of True.

Please note that statement-level test information for BerkeleyDB and TankWar has not been disclosed. Therefore, RQ3 is set to "True" only for the remaining six product lines.

All experimental results are stored in the ./experiment_results folder. For each case, suspicious feature interactions are recorded in the spc_10.log file within the respective case directory.
